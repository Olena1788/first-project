# Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire process. 

The following tests were conducted to determine the site works well. 

## Validator Testing 

### W3C Validator

The [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all four pages of the website. No errors or warnings were found on html pages.

The [Jigsaw W3](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate CSS code. All the  errors on CSS validation were related to [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v6.0/icons).
